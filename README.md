### Overview

VulpesPro is an AI augmented cognitive extension for the modern radiologist. Built on the bleeding edge of the **Google Gemini 3** architecture, it fuses advanced clinical reasoning capabilities and active context driven guidance with a stunning, distraction-free interface designed to induce and maintain a radiologist's flow state.

This is where high-performance computing meets high-stakes diagnostics.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Clinical Guidance Engine**: Integrated high yield prep summary, checklists, ACR Appropriateness Criteria and guideline retrieval. It acts as a senior consultant, instantly available at your fingertips to ensure every study is augmented in a way which makes us work smarter and quicker, all at once.
*   **Seamless Dictation**: Native, low-latency voice integration for rapid reporting.
*   **Intelligent Differentials**: Real-time generation of differential diagnoses, weighted by likelihood and clinical rationale. It doesn't just report; it thinks with you, offering a second pair of eyes on complex cases.
*   **Finalize Report**: A comprehensive review workflow that allows for Q&A with the AI, refinement of language, and a final polish before signing off.
*   **Digital Impressionism**: A dynamic, AI-generated ambient background system powered by Imagen 4. It creates unique, non-distracting art based on medical concepts to reduce fatigue and keep you inspired.




### Prerequisites

To unleash the full potential of VulpesPro, you require:

1.  **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2.  **A Google Gemini API Key** (Critical)

**The Engine Requires Fuel.**
VulpesPro relies on the Google Gemini API for its intelligence and image generation capabilities. Without a valid API key, the system will function in a limited capacity, and the "Digital Impressionism" engine will fall back to static assets.

### Installation & Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulpespro.git
    cd vulpespro
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Intelligence**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can enter your API key directly within the application's Settings panel.*

4.  **Ignition**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Access the interface at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Usage Philosophy

VulpesPro is designed to be intuitive yet powerful.
1.  **Input**: Paste your clinical brief or dictate it. The more clinical input parameters you provide the more helpful the guidance.
2.  **Guidance**: Review AI-generated clinical guidance and appropriateness criteria.
3.  **Differentials**: Explore weighted differential diagnoses generated by the AI.
4.  **Finalize**: Refine the report, ask questions, and finalize the output.
