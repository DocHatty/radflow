## 🎯 What is RADFLOW?

**RADFLOW** is the AI-powered cognitive co-pilot for elite radiologists who refuse to compromise on precision, speed, or excellence.

Built on **flexible multi-provider AI architecture** (supporting Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, OpenRouter, Perplexity, and more), RADFLOW deploys a **sophisticated multi-agent AI system** that works in parallel to provide:
- **Real-time clinical intelligence** across 8 simultaneous guidance streams
- **Adaptive differential diagnosis** that evolves with your findings
- **Context-aware orchestration** routing each cognitive task to specialized AI models
- **Evidence-grounded recommendations** with automatic web search when needed
- **Interactive AI consultation** for complex case discussions

This isn't just software. It's **high-performance AI meeting high-stakes medicine**—seamlessly integrated into a distraction-free workspace engineered to maintain your flow state, where your best diagnostic work happens.

## ✨ Experience the Difference

### **🧠 Real-World Rundown: AI Clinical Intelligence**
Your attending radiologist's knowledge, instantly available. RADFLOW's groundbreaking **parallel AI architecture** simultaneously generates **8 comprehensive clinical guidance sections** plus a separate appropriateness evaluation in real-time:
- **Most Likely Diagnoses** - Weighted differentials based on imaging findings
- **Top Facts** - High-yield pearls for rapid decision-making  
- **What to Look For** - Systematic search strategy for the specific case
- **Pitfalls & Mimics** - Critical don't-miss warnings and lookalikes
- **Search Pattern** - Optimized workflow checklists
- **Pertinent Negatives** - Key findings to document for completeness
- **Classic Signs** - Pathognomonic features to confirm diagnoses
- **Bottom Line** - Synthesized clinical recommendation

Plus: **ACR Appropriateness Criteria** evaluation with intelligent web grounding—when the AI needs more context, it automatically searches authoritative sources to provide evidence-based guidance.

### **🎙️ Seamless Voice Dictation**
Native, low-latency speech recognition engineered for radiology workflows. Speak naturally, report effortlessly. Your voice becomes structured findings instantly.

### **🔍 Intelligent Differential Diagnosis**
Experience AI that **evolves with your case**. RADFLOW generates weighted differential diagnoses in real-time, then intelligently refines them as you add findings—removing outdated possibilities and suggesting new considerations. Get ranked differentials with clinical rationale, imaging features, and next-step recommendations. It's like having a diagnostic reasoning consultant at your fingertips.

### **✅ Finalize with Confidence**
A comprehensive AI-powered review system ensures excellence:
- **Interactive Q&A** - Chat with the AI about complex cases, ask for clarifications, explore alternative diagnoses
- **Guideline-Aware Review** - Integrated knowledge base of major radiology guidelines (Fleischer, Bosniak, ACR, LI-RADS) ensures follow-up recommendations meet best practices
- **Language Refinement** - AI polishes your prose while preserving your medical precision
- **Quality Assurance** - Final checklist review before sign-off

Every report, clinically sound and eloquently presented.

### **🎨 Digital Impressionism**
A revolutionary ambient workspace powered by **Imagen** (when using Google Gemini provider, dynamically selects the best available version—3.0, 4.0, or newer). Each session generates unique, AI-created medical concept art in the style of master impressionists—dynamic visualizations of neurological landscapes, cardiovascular systems, and cellular structures. Beautiful enough to inspire, subtle enough to prevent distraction during marathon reading sessions.

*Note: Image generation requires a Google Gemini provider with Imagen model support.*

## 🧬 The AI Architecture

RADFLOW represents a paradigm shift in how AI assists radiological interpretation. Unlike simple chatbots, RADFLOW implements a **multi-agent orchestration system** with specialized intelligence at every stage:

### Multi-Provider Support
RADFLOW supports multiple AI providers, giving you the flexibility to choose the best model for each task:
- **Google Gemini** - Advanced multi-modal models with grounding capabilities and Imagen for background generation
- **OpenAI** - GPT-4 and other models for high-quality text generation
- **Anthropic Claude** - Claude 3 models with extended context windows
- **OpenRouter** - Access to multiple models through a unified API
- **Perplexity** - Specialized models with built-in search capabilities
- **Custom Providers** - Configure custom base URLs for self-hosted or proxy endpoints

Each provider can be configured with its own model assignments, allowing you to optimize for cost, speed, or quality on a per-task basis.

### Parallel Processing Pipeline
When you input a case, RADFLOW's **Real-World Rundown** launches **8 independent AI tasks** that process simultaneously (plus a separate appropriateness evaluation):
- Each task is optimized for a specific cognitive function (differential generation, pitfall detection, search pattern creation, etc.)
- Responses arrive asynchronously as they complete, keeping you in flow
- Total guidance generation: **~15-30 seconds** for comprehensive clinical intelligence that would take humans hours to research

### Intelligent Task Routing
The **AI Orchestrator** analyzes each request and routes it to the optimal model:
- **JSON-structured tasks** (categorization, differentials) → High-precision schema-validated models
- **Streaming tasks** (report drafting, impression synthesis) → Models optimized for natural language generation
- **Grounding-enabled tasks** (appropriateness evaluation) → Models with web search capabilities when local knowledge is insufficient (currently Google Gemini only)
- **Image generation** (ambient backgrounds) → Imagen models (Google Gemini only) with carefully crafted impressionist prompts

### Context-Aware Intelligence
Unlike isolated AI calls, RADFLOW maintains **semantic context** across the entire workflow:
- Clinical history informs appropriateness evaluation
- Appropriateness insights guide the Real-World Rundown sections
- Dictated findings automatically trigger differential refinement
- Selected differentials integrate seamlessly into impression synthesis
- Every AI interaction builds on previous understanding

### Adaptive Learning
The differential diagnosis system demonstrates true **reactive intelligence**:
1. Initial generation based on clinical history and study type
2. **Continuous monitoring** of your dictated findings
3. **Automatic refinement** when findings change—removing outdated differentials, adding newly relevant ones
4. Ranking and weighting based on supporting/refuting evidence
5. Clinical rationale for each diagnosis with key imaging features

This is **AI that thinks alongside you**, not just responds to prompts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

Before experiencing RADFLOW, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **AI Provider API Key** — At least one of:
  - [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/) (Default, recommended for full feature support)
  - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
